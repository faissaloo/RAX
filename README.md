RAX
======
RAX, named after the x86_64 accumulator register, is a program designed for
counting things, because it can be difficult to keep count and sometimes your
fingers just aren't enough.  

This was very much an exercise in 'how many bells and whistles can you add to
something so simple'.  GPR
